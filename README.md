# Solars Tracker

A lightweight Foundry VTT module that monitors currency changes and logs a transaction receipt to the chat.

Made with AI, I have no idea what I'm doing, so hopefully it works!

**Manifest** https://github.com/AzureCamel/Solars-Tracker/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Features

* **Automatic Logging:** Detects changes to actor data (default: `system.solars`) and calculates the difference.
* **Private Receipts:** Chat messages are whispered only to the GM and the actor's owners.
* **Visual Feedback:** Displays positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
